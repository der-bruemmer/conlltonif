ConLL to NIF
=================

Goal of this project is to convert sufficiently arbitrary, depnedency annotated ConLL corpora into NIF (nlp2rdf.org).

#Initial version

This repository contains an eclipse project with some java code. At the moment, it is able to parse the ConLL format and transform into custom java objects. An example resource is provided in /resources/sentence.conll
